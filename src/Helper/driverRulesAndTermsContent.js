    serviceRules : `Meeting eligibility requirements: To become a ride-sharing driver, you must meet certain eligibility requirements set by the company you are working for. These requirements typically include having a valid driver's license, a clean driving record, and adequate insurance coverage. You may also need to pass a background check and have access to a reliable vehicle that meets the company's standards.

Accepting ride requests: Once you're approved to drive for a ride-sharing company, you'll need to be prepared to accept ride requests promptly and to complete those rides in a timely manner.

This means performing regular oil changes, tire rotations, and other necessary repairs, as well as keeping the interior of the vehicle free of debris and clutter.

Maintaining personal hygiene: As a ride-sharing driver, you are representing the ride-sharing company and are expected to maintain a clean and professional appearance, including personal hygiene.

You are expected to avoid discrimination against passengers based on their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics. Failure to do so could result in legal action and deactivation from the platform.

As a ride-sharing driver, you are expected to drive safely and responsibly, obeying all traffic laws and avoiding accidents and other incidents that could put passengers at risk.
